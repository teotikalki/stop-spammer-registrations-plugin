Uses the StopForumSpam.com database to validate emails and deny registration to spammers.

== Description ==
The Stop Spammer Registrations Plugin Plugin Accesses the StopForumSpam.com db to check emails before a user can register. The StopForumSpam database contains over a million spammer emails and is updated daily. 

Many spam solutions are concerned with comments. This plugin validates email addresses and is primarily concerned with registrations. I have a website where I needed to allow registrations, but the users would probably not comment. This plugin kept the flood of registrations down to a manageable few.

A list of the last 20 emails denied access is included under the plugin setup page.

 
== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.
